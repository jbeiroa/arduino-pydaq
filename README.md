# arduino-pydaq
DAQ system with Arduino (UNO) board and python, using wx and matplotlib for GUI.
===============
Python and Arduino scripts for temperature and voltage acquisition with a Sensirion SHT71 sensor and built in ADC converter. Sensirion library can be downloaded from https://github.com/practicalarduino/SHT1x .

Connection with the Arduino board is made using python serial (modified from Kevin Hughes https://github.com/kevinhughes27/arduinoDAQ). The gui script uses wxpython and matplotlib, also made by modifications of Hughes original implementation, and others.
